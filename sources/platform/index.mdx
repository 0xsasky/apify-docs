_Apify_ is a cloud platform that helps you build reliable web scrapers, and automate anything you can do manually in a web browser. It's designed for large-scale and high-performance web scraping and automation. The platform provides easy access to compute instances([Actors](/platform/actors)), storage for requests and results, proxies, request queues, scheduling, webhooks, and more. All of those tools are accessible through the [Apify Console](platform/console) web interface, [Apify API](/api/v2), or our [JavaScript](api/client/js) and [Python](api/client/python) API clients.

_Actors_ are serverless cloud programs running on the Apify platform. The can crawl websites with millions of pages or perform diverse computing jobs like sending emails or data transformations. You can start Actors manually via our API, or with the scheduler, and they integrate easily with other applications.
