Integrations allow you to combine separate applications and take advantage of their combined capabilities. Automation of these online processes increases your productivity. Thatâ€™s why we made Apify in a way that allows you to connect it with practically any cloud service or web app - and make it part of your larger projects.

## Built-in integrations

Apifyâ€˜s RESTful API allows you to interact with the platform programmatically, and HTTP webhooks notify you and your services when important events happen. By using API you can start Actors, retrieve their results, or basically do anything you can do in platform UI

<CardGrid>
    <Card
        title="API"
        desc="Control Apify platform programmatically from your code."
        to="/platform/integrations/api"
    />
    <Card
        title="Webhooks"
        desc="Trigger external events when your actor run fails or succeeds."
        to="/platform/integrations/webhooks"
    />
</CardGrid><br />

Apify offers easy-to-set-up solutions for common scenarios. Like uploading your datasets to Google Drive when the run succeeds or creating an issue on GitHub when it fails.

    <Card

        desc="TODO"
        to="/platform/integrations/slack"
    />
    <Card
        title="Drive"
        desc="TODO"
        to="/platform/integrations/drive"
    />
    <Card
        title="Gmail"
        desc="TODO"
        to="/platform/integrations/gmail"
    />
    <Card
        title="Github"
        desc="TODO"
        to="/platform/integrations/github"
    />
    <Card
        title="Git"
        desc="TODO"
        to="/platform/actors/development/source-code#git-repository"
    />
</CardGrid>

## Integration platforms

If you are a user of one of the main integration platforms then we have Apify support ready for you. The main advantage of these platforms is that you can integrate Apify into very complex workflows with the choice of thousands of services supported.

- [Make](./integrations/make)
- [Zapier](./integrations/zapier)
- [Transposit](./integrations/transposit)
- TODO: Asana

## ETLs and data pipelines

Apify platform integrates with popular ETL and data pipeline services, enabling you to integrate Apify Actors directly into your data integration processes.

- [Keboola](./integrations/keboola)
- [Airbyte](./integrations/airbyte)
- [Hevo](./integrations/hevo)

## Other Actors


At last, explore the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) for Actors that may help with the integration into your stack as, for example, [MongoDB Import](https://apify.com/drobnikj/mongodb-import) or [MySQL Insert](https://apify.com/petr_cermak/mysql-insert).
