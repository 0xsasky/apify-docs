:::tip Before building your own Actor

Before you start building your own Actor,you might want to try out existing Actors from [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store). See the [Running Actors](../../running/index.md) section for more information on running existing Actors.

:::

## Choose you programming language

You can turn any code that runs inside a Docker container into an Apify [Actor](../../index.mdx). This gives you flexibility in choosing your technical stack.

However, to fully benefit from the Apify platform we recommend using JavaScript/Node.js or Python. Apify provides comprehensive SDKs, API clients, and learning materials for these languages.

You can also choose from many code templates to kickstart your project:

</a>

## How to create your Actor

You can create an Actor in two main ways:

- _Using the Web IDE in Apify Console_: This is the fastest way to get started with Actor development and explore the Apify platform.
- _Developing locally on your machine_: This approach lets you use your preferred local setup for better development and debugging experience. Once ready, you can easily [deploy](./deployment) your Actor to the Apify platform.

Choose your preferred path to begin:

<CardGrid>
    <Card
        title="Use the Apify Console Web IDE"
        to="/platform/actors/development/quick-start/web-ide"
    />
    <Card
        title="Develop locally on your machine"
        to="/platform/actors/development/quick-start/locally"
    />
</CardGrid>
