Actors are fundamental to the Apify platform. Understanding them is the first step to fully grasp Apify's capabilities for web scraping, automation, and more.

## What is an Actor?

When you deploy your code to the Apify Platform, it becomes an _Actor_. An Actor is a serverless program that accepts an input (usually in JSON format) and produces an output.

Actors are versatile:

- They can perform simple actions, such as filling out a web form or sending an email.
- They cah handle complex operations, like crawling an entire website or removing duplicates from a large dataset.
- Their execution time can vary from few seconds, to hours, or even run indefinitely for continuous tasks.

While many Actors on the Apify platform are designed for web scraping, data extraction, and browser automation, they are not limited to these tasks. An Actor can be any program that runs inside a Docker container.

Once an Actor is on the Apify platform, you can share it with the world through [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store).
Public Actors can also be monetized.

:::tip Try it out for yourself

To get a practical understanding of Apify Actors, visit the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store), and try some out!

You can typically find an Actor, configure its input if needed (many have sensible defaults), start it, and then view its results once the run is complete.

You can interact with Actor in several ways:

- Manually in the [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/actors)
- Programmatically using the [Apify API](/api/v2)
- By scheduling them to run automatically using the [scheduler](platform/schedules)

Additionally, you can easily [integrate Actors with other applications](platform/integrations/index) and manage access for collaboration using the [access right system](platform/collaboration/access-rights).

### Actors are containers

Behind the scenes, an Actor consists of your source code packaged with all of its dependencies into a Docker image. This containerized approach ensures that your Actor runs consistently across different environments.

You can think of an Actor as a cloud application or service running on the Apify platform.Its run is not limited to the lifetime of a single HTTP transaction, it can persist for as long as necessary to complete its task.

### Public and private Actors

Actors on the Apify platform can be either public or private:

- _Private Actors_ are visible and usable only by you (and those you grant access to). They are suitable for proprietary tools or internal projects.
- _Public Actors_ are listed in the Apify Store and are available for anyone to use. You can offer them for free or [set a price for their usage](https://blog.apify.com/make-regular-passive-income-developing-web-automation-actors-b0392278d085/).
