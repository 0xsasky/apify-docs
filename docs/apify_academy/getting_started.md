Internal draft of the structure. Inspired by https://gitlab.com/apify-public/wiki/-/wikis/home

Different categories might be split into more articles. Since we have already pretty detailed documentation about most services, this academy will focus on listing other resources to read and glueing them together with the web scraping academy code tutorials (upgrading the code)

I'm not happy with the top level category names

- Setting up Apify project
    - Apify CLI (create base project structure)
    - Apify SDK (upgrading scraping academy code to use the SDK)
    - Apify Actors (deploy the code as an actor)
    - Apify Proxy (add proxies)
- Apify services & integration
    - Tasks (create a few versions of an actor)
    - Storage (save named data)
    - Apify client & API (setup integration from another actor/local)
    - Webhooks
- Advanced concepts
    - Actor migrations (persist state)
